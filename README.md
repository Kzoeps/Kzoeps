### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Me llamo Karma, and thats all i know from my 2 semesters of spanish. Elevator pitch (3 bullet points):

1. 23 y/o majoring in computer science and tryna be on the frontiers of what is cool
2. Want to build a lotta indie businesses and do my part in uplifting the prospects of my country, family & friends (v patriotic)
3. Think im pretty confident in myself and who I am and that helps me .... umm be happier?

I love to build and kinda wanna earn from one of my creations and thats one of my short term goals right now. 

Im ~~currently~~ just graduated from college in 2025 and am trying to make ~~full use of my free time and with that tryna push myself to build 10 viable products that have a shot at making money~~ sense of where im trying to go and what im trying to do (cliche as it sounds), a mix of laziness and a want to come back home means im now in my favorite city (t-city) hopefully be able to live here for good and in comfort but i guess we'll see.
