### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Me llama Karma, and thats all i know from my 2 semesters of spanish. I love to build and kinda wanna earn from one of my creations and thats one of my short term goals right now. Im currently in college and am trying to make full use of my free time and with that tryna push myself to build 10 viable products that have a shot at making money. Pero(i know one more word) the progress has been slow, so far im only 2/10(1 of them was a complete failure, the other one is [zimchu](https://zimchu.com) and im working on it here and there.
